This is a forcing file used for MLCan model. The forcing file is set up for Arizona Charleston Mesquite (CM) site for year 2015-2016. Year 2015 is used for spin up and year 2016 is the simulation period. 

Use this forcing file to simulate for Arizona CM site and generate results. For the publication (Lee et al., 2019), 2016 simulation data is used.
