datasets for Lee, Kumar, Barron-Gafford, et al, WRR 2018

AZ_SRM_MLCanConfig2015.mat: configuration file to set up for Santa Rita Mesquite (SRM) site before running Multi-layer canopy (MLCan) model. Configuration file includes soil & radiation parameters (% of sand, % of clay, reflection coefficient, etc), respiration & microenvironment parameters (Ro, Q10), leaf & canopy parameters (leaf width, canopy height, fluc tower height, etc), and photosynthesis parameters (Vcmac, Jmax, Rd25, etc). Use this configuration file to run MLCan to generate results published in Lee, Kumar, Barron-Gafford, et al, WRR 2018. 

AZ_SRM_MLCanForcing2015.mat: forcing file for Santa Rita Mesquite (SRM) site to run Multi-layer canopy (MLCan) model. Forcing file includes leaf area indices of coexisting plants, leaf area density over the canopy, etc. Use this forcing file to run MLCan to generate results published in Lee, Kumar, Barron-Gafford, et al, WRR 2018. 

AZ_SRM_MLCanForcing2015.xlsx: forcing file for Santa Rita Mesquite (SRM) site to run Multi-layer canopy (MLCan) model. Forcing file includes leaf area indices of coexisting plants, leaf area density over the canopy, etc.

AZ_SRM_Measured_and_ModeledData2015.xlsx: data used for the generating figures in Lee, Kumar, Barron-Gafford, et al., 2018.

Figure 1: measured and modeled energy fluxes (G, H, and LE) in 2015
Figure 2: shortwave radiation, precipitation, and LAIs of tree and grass
Figure 3: root distributions in different soil depths for tree and grass roots
Figure 7: sap flow measurements and amount of hydraulic redistribution based on simulation (modeled HR+TH and modeled HR)
Figure B1: measured and modeled soil moisture data in different depths

README_DATASETS.xls: readme file for SR20XX.mat

README_SOILDATA.xls: readme file for SRsoil20XX.mat provides depths of soil where soil moisture and temperature are measured. 

SR20XX.mat: measured flux tower data at Santa Rita Mesquite (SRM) site. Each file provides 30-minutes interval data for a year. Data includes precipitation, solar radiation, energy fluxes, etc. (flux tower data provided by USDA-ARS. Please contact Russ Scott at russ.scott@ars.usda.gov if you have any questions)

SRsoil20XX.mat: measured soil moisture and soil temperature over depth at Santa Rita Mesquite (SRM) site. Each file provides 30-minutes interval data for a year. (soil data provided by USDA-ARS. Please contact Russ Scott at russ.scott@ars.usda.gov if you have any questions)
