README

Software required: Matlab.

Description: This folder contains the project and the forcing files used for MLCan model. The files are set up for 
Goose Creek Flux Tower (GCFT) from 23 April 2016 to 15 April 2019. Each year independently. 

Use these forcing files to generate simulated results for Maize and Soybean, C_m and C_s respectively, in Equations 7 - 9
in the reference publication. 


Additional data included in this folder: 

"Analysis" folder provides the additional data needed to estimate the results shown in the reference publication, as follows:

Obsfluxes.mat: Observed tower fluxes from April 23, 2016, to April 15, 2019. η in Equations 8 & 9.
Weights.mat: Weighted contribution of momentum flux for maize and soybean, φ_m and φ_s in Equations 5 - 9.
